# SOLID Principles Examples

This repository contains practical examples demonstrating the SOLID principles from Robert C. Martin's "Clean Architecture" book. Each principle is illustrated with both correct and defective implementations to show the importance of proper software design.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Rule_S(SRP)/Correct_Example_1** - Proper implementation following SRP
- **Rule_S(SRP)/Defect_Example_1** - Violation of SRP showing common mistakes
- **Rule_S(SRP)/Defect_Example_2** - Additional SRP violation examples

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Rule_O(OCP)** - Examples showing how code should be open for extension but closed for modification

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Rule_L(LSP)/Correct_Example_L1** - Proper inheritance hierarchy
- **Rule_L(LSP)/Defect_Example_L1** - LSP violations with Rectangle/Square problem

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Rule_I(ISP)/Correct_Example_I1** - Well-segregated interfaces
- **Rule_I(ISP)/Defect_Example_L1** - Fat interface problems

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Rule_D(DIP)** - Dependency injection and inversion examples
